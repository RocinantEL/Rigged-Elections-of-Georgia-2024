# Rigged-Elections-of-Georgia-2024
as you can see, here we present our project that proves the falsification of the elections 2024 in Georgia.
all the "CSV", "xlsx" and "pbx" files are data sets used in the codes except of the files "Election-Charts" and "Final-Source".
"Election-Charts" file shows how the Fig.1 in the paper was constructed based on official "CEC" data sets.
"Final-Source" file is a very general file where you can find many different analysis of the official data, including distributions votes in each electoral district.
"Statistics of CESKO" file is a dataset of the turnouts and percentages of "Georgian Dream Party", and this file is used for Density graph in tha paper (Fig.2)
"density" file is the code that constructs the Fig.2 in the paper
"election_size" is the dataset of the precincts and how many people voted in those precincts in total (used in the main code)
